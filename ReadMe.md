This is a real-time monocular visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system leverage environmental **planes** within a multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework.
At the core of our method is an efficient robust monocular-based plane detection algorithm which does not require additional sensing modalities such as a stereo, depth camera or neural network.
The project is built on top of [OpenVINS](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins) and thus shares similar tooling and architecture.
This plane detection and tracking algorithm enables real-time regularization of point features to environmental planes which are either maintained in the state vector as long-lived planes, or marginalized for efficiency.
Planar regularities are applied to both in-state SLAM and out-of-state MSCKF point features, enabling long-term point-to-plane loop-closures due to the large spacial volume of planes.

## Installation and Building

You will need to ensure you have installed OpenCV 3 or 4, Eigen3, Ceres Solver, and a valid ROS 1 installation.
Please additionally refer to the OpenVINS [Installation Guide](https://docs.openvins.com/gs-installing.html) as dependencies are shared with it.
For Ubuntu linux-based system the system dependencies are (in addition to [ROS 1](https://docs.openvins.com/gs-installing.html#gs-install-ros-1)):

```bash
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev libboost-all-dev libceres-dev
```

We now setup a catkin workspace with both OpenVINS and the ov_plane project.
Specifically, we can clone both projects:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/catkin_ws_plane/src/
cd ~/workspace/catkin_ws_plane/src/
git clone https://github.com/rpng/open_vins/
git clone https://github.com/rpng/ov_plane/ 
cd open_vins/
git checkout 74a63cf758f595cc280f2165e5a6576e7ef8521d # last tested OpenVINS commit
cd ~/workspace/catkin_ws_plane/
catkin build
source devel/setup.bash 
```


## Running - Simulation

We extended the OpenVINS simulator to simulated environmental planes which contain environmental features.
A certain number of points are simulated as being planar and "free" non-planar per frame.
This simulator leverages a C++ implementation of our [lips](https://github.com/rpng/lips) simulator.

```bash
roslaunch ov_plane simulation.launch
```

To generate simulation results, one inspect the [results/run_simulation.sh](results/run_simulation.sh) script to reproduce the results of the paper.
To evaluate the results relative to the groundtruth please refer to [ov_eval](https://docs.openvins.com/namespaceov__eval.html) of OpenVINS.
The code has changed since publication to upgrade to the newest OpenVINS, but the results should still be representative.


## Running - Real-World Datasets

We support both the [The EuRoC MAV Dataset](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) and our released [RPNG AR Table Dataset](https://github.com/rpng/ar_table_dataset) datasets.
To run on either real-world dataset, use one of the following commands:

```bash
roslaunch ov_plane serial.launch config:=euroc_mav dataset:=V1_01_easy bag:=<path_to_bag>
roslaunch ov_plane serial.launch config:=rpng_plane dataset:=table_01  bag:=<path_to_bag>
rviz -d ~/ros_ws/plane_ws/src/ov_plane/ov_plane/launch/display.rviz 
```

Users can reproduce the results presented in our publication with the scripts provided in the [results/](results/) folder.
We additionally provide the script used to compute the evaluation, which are simple calls to [ov_eval](https://docs.openvins.com/namespaceov__eval.html) of OpenVINS.
The groundtruth "truths" files can be found in [ov_data](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins/tree/master/ov_data).
Please note the project has been updated since the time of publication and thus will cause slight variations in performance relative to the paper

```bash
./src/ov_plane/results/run_ros_eth.sh        # Euroc MAV
./src/ov_plane/results/run_ros_rpng_plane.sh # RPNG Indoor AR Table
./src/ov_plane/results/run_ros_tracking.sh   # Tracking statistics
```
